My account still won't allow me to publish to Youtube, but I can show you my project running in class.

## Project Description

My animation allows a user to order frozen yogurt by prompting them to select a flavor and a topping. The user can decide between vanilla, strawberry, or chocolate for the flavors and syrup, fruit, or sprinkles for the toppings. After the user types their selection, it prints a text receipt of their order and then animates the ice cream being created on a countertop. I liked getting to have the user decide their experience with this project and it was fun designing the graphics.

I figured out that I needed the super(null, null) line in my code in Flavor.java and Topping.java with the help of chatGPT.
